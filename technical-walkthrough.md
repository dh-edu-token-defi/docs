# Technical Walkthrough

This section provides a comprehensive guide through the technical components and workflow of the Meme Token Launcher project.

## Architecture Overview

The Meme Token Launcher is composed of several interconnected modules:

1. **Frontend Application**: A user-friendly interface built with React and TypeScript.
2. **Smart Contracts**: Deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging Solidity for token creation and management.
3. **Backend Services**: Node.js services for handling off-chain operations and data storage.

## Workflow

### 1. Token Creation
- Users fill out a form on the frontend.
- Data is sent to a backend service, which interacts with smart contracts to mint a new token.

### 2. Liquidity Provision
- The launcher wraps ETH to WETH.
- It interacts with Uniswap V3 to create a new liquidity pool using the minted tokens and WETH.

### 3. Community Engagement
- Users can vote on various proposals using their tokens.
- Voting power is proportional to the number of tokens held.

## Smart Contract Details

### **Token Contract**
- Implements ERC-20 standards for fungible tokens.
- Implements ERC-20Votes Baal standards for governance tokens.
- Includes additional functionalities for meme-specific features.

### **Liquidity Pool Contract**
- Handles interactions with Uniswap V3.

## Security Measures
- Comprehensive unit tests using Hardhat.
- Ongoing monitoring for vulnerabilities and exploits.

## Deployment Process
1. Smart contracts are deployed using Hardhat.
2. Frontend is built and deployed using GitHub Actions.
3. Continuous integration and deployment ensure that updates are automatically tested and deployed.

By following this technical walkthrough, developers can understand the inner workings of the Meme Token Launcher and contribute to its development and maintenance.
