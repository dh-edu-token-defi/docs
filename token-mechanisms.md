yeet fees go into a shared pool that rewards successful yeets. 
- would compound as more yeets are attempted and some fail. 
- create incentive for pre sale participants
- creates volatility with new pool
- could be used to incentives first successfull yeets with garunteed max reward (if pool is bootstrapped with some funds)

example: 10% fee on yeet
- 9% to shared reward pool (more of a yeet deposit)
- 1% to yeeter/ph dev

on success (meets threshold in time window)
- claim reward before execute on transfer % to safe (min 9%, max ??)
- execute then creates a pool with more native funds

will need a new contract/module that tallies rewards for claims. this could be on a meme DAO as well
